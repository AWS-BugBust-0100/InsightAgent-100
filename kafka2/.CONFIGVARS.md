* **`data_format`**: The format of the data to parse: CSV, JSON, or RAW 
* **`csv_field_names`**: A list of field names for CSV input. Required, even if the CSV to parse has a header.
* `json_top_level`: The top-level of fields to parse in JSON. For example, if all fields of interest are nested like 
```
{ 
  "output": {
    "parsed": {
      "time": time, 
      "log": log message,
      ... 
    }   
    ... 
  }
  ...

* `timestamp_field`: Field name for the timestamp. Default is `timestamp`.

* `device_field`: Field name for the device/container for containerized projects.
* `data_fields`: Comma-delimited list of field names to use as data fields. If not set, all fields will be reported.
* `metric_name_field`: If this is set, only the first value in `data_fields` will be used as the field containing the value for the metric who's name is contained here.
* `agent_http_proxy`: HTTP proxy used to connect to the agent.
* `agent_https_proxy`: As above, but HTTPS.
The following settings control SSL and SASL. Please refer to the [documentation](https://kafka-python.readthedocs.io/en/master/apidoc/KafkaConsumer.html) for the Kafka consumer for further details on each.

* **`license_key`**: License Key from your Account Profile in the InsightFinder UI. 
* **`project_name`**: Name of the project created in the InsightFinder UI. 
* **`project_type`**: Type of the project - one of `metric, metricreplay, log, logreplay, incident, incidentreplay, alert, alertreplay, deployment, deploymentreplay`.
* **`sampling_interval`**: How frequently data is collected. Should match the interval used in project settings.
* `chunk_size_kb`: Size of chunks (in KB) to send to InsightFinder. Default is `2048`.
* `if_url`: URL for InsightFinder. Default is `https://app.insightfinder.com`.
* `if_http_proxy`: HTTP proxy used to connect to InsightFinder.
* `if_https_proxy`: As above, but HTTPS.
