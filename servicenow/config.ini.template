## message parsing
# timestamp format, as per python strptime. multiple fields can be formatted together to create the timestamp a la `{date} {time}`, where `date` and `time` are fields that each contain part of the timestamp. If multiple fields could contain the timestamp, a comma-delimited list may be entered (no value of which may use the aforementioned {formatting}), of which the first found will be selected (treating the list as a priority list). ex `timestamp1,timestamp2`
timestamp_format = %Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S

Use `::==` as a separator to treat `<value>` as a mathematical formula, which must be parseable by `eval()`.
